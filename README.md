This repository contains all the R scripts that I used to analyse data for my Master's thesis.
Files "Range finding experiment", "Pilot experiment" and "Final experiment" contain a very similar script, as the endpoints were the same. They analyse data from the zooplankton community experiments.
File "Nauplii experiment" has the script for analysing data from the nauplii experiment.
